## Sentiment Analysis of Microposts

Microblogging environments are populated with content from a huge number of contributors on just about any given topic. The volume and characteristics of microposts presents its user with a vast amount of data that can be used to determine the sentiment associated with a query. For example, consider a political candidate, a product, a company, an song, a movie, or an idea for which you want to know what people feel about. Are they happy, excited, angry? 

In this project a web application will be created that given a query the sentiment associated with that query will determined. 
Twitter will be used as a data source. Twitter provides an API for fetching and filtering its content.
The content will be fetched and processed to discover the sentiment towards a user query.
